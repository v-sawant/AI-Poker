# Abstract
Our project has been implemented using an agent with perception of own hand, which is basically uses own hand strength (the concept of hand strength is an addition of hand type value and card rank values). The strategy used here is simple and easy to understand. There are two main phases of the game viz. Betting phase and draw phase. The agent implemented bluff for open action as opposed to its hand strength and bet aggressively on further betting rounds. During betting phase, an agent performs different actions. Player needs to decide what open action to choose; agent can just check the round with a forced bet or open with some amount or go all-in. In the next betting rounds, the agent can fold, call, all-in or raise the bet based on the strategy. We observed that my agent won three matches. That is, it has won total 15% of matches out of 20 game executions performed during pre-tournament. However, the success can be further increased if we could have got if we have added few more features like opponent modelling, a Bayesian probabilistic model, etc.
